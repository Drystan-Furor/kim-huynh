# OUR DESTINATION
- As our vision for the perfect nail salon experience has taken shape and form, we fine-tune and adjust along the
journey, while we continue to be inspired by our clients.
- We constantly evolve and innovate our brand experience. Although our primary objective remains providing exquisite
nail treatments, we plan to extent our service portfolio to offering beauty treatments as well.
- Our vision is to expand Modern Nails not only in The Netherlands but also in core markets like Belgium and Germany.
Therefore we are looking for prime locations to expand within shopping centers like Rotterdam Alexandrium.
